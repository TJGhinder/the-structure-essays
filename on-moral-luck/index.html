        <p>We praise the surgeon whose hand was steady and blame the one whose hand trembled — yet neither chose their nerves. We admire the person who risked their life to save a stranger and wonder whether we would do the same, knowing full well that the answer depends on a thousand variables we do not control: our upbringing, our neurochemistry, whether we had enough sleep the night before. Moral luck is the elephant in every courtroom, every performance review, every eulogy.</p>

        <p>Bernard Williams and Thomas Nagel identified the problem in the late 1970s, but humanity has been living with it since the first tribe punished a hunter for bad weather. The core insight is devastating in its simplicity: much of what we praise and blame people for depends on factors beyond their control. The drunk driver who arrives home safely and the one who kills a pedestrian made the same moral choice. Only luck distinguishes them.</p>

        <blockquote>If moral responsibility requires control, and control is largely an illusion, then the entire edifice of praise and blame rests on a foundation of sand.</blockquote>

        <p>This does not mean we should abandon moral judgment. It means we should hold it more lightly. <a href="/the-examined-life/" class="backlink">The examined life</a> includes examining the degree to which our moral assessments are distorted by outcomes we did not foresee and circumstances we did not create. When we judge others harshly, we might pause to ask: how much of their failure was truly theirs?</p>

        <p>The political implications are profound. <a href="/social-contract-reimagined/" class="backlink">The social contract</a> typically assumes a baseline of moral agency — that citizens are capable of rational deliberation and responsible choice. But if moral luck is pervasive, this assumption becomes suspect. The person who breaks the law may have been dealt a hand that made law-abiding behavior extraordinarily difficult. This does not excuse the action, but it should inform our response to it.</p>

        <p>In <a href="/virtue-in-the-digital-age/" class="backlink">the digital realm</a>, moral luck takes new forms. The person whose ill-considered tweet goes viral faces consequences wildly disproportionate to those faced by the person who posted the same thought to an audience of twelve. The moral content is identical; only the algorithmic luck differs.</p>

        <p>A mature moral philosophy does not pretend that luck does not exist. It builds luck into its framework, tempering justice with humility, and punishment with the recognition that there but for fortune go any of us.</p>
