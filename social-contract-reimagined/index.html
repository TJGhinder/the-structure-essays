        <p>Rousseau asked us to imagine a contract none of us signed. Hobbes asked us to imagine a world so terrible that any government would be preferable. Locke offered us the comforting fiction of tacit consent — as if remaining in a country were the same as endorsing its laws. The social contract tradition is built on thought experiments that no one actually experienced, and yet it remains the dominant framework for political legitimacy in the Western world.</p>

        <p>The trouble with thought experiments is that they can prove almost anything. Rawls understood this when he placed his contractors behind the veil of ignorance, stripping them of the very identities that make political life contentious. His achievement was to make fairness a logical necessity rather than a moral aspiration. But even Rawls could not escape the fundamental problem: real people did not choose from behind a veil. They were born into a world already structured by power.</p>

        <blockquote>We are asked to honour a contract we never signed, in a language we were taught by the very institution that claims our obedience.</blockquote>

        <p>This has implications for what <a href="/the-examined-life/" class="backlink">the examined life</a> actually requires of citizens. If we have not consented to the state, what is the nature of our obligation to it? The answer cannot simply be "gratitude for services rendered" — that logic would justify any protection racket. Nor can it be "you're free to leave" — a response that ignores the enormous costs of emigration and the fact that every habitable territory on Earth is already claimed by some state or another.</p>

        <p>Perhaps the most honest approach is to abandon consent as the foundation of political legitimacy altogether and replace it with something more modest: ongoing justification. A state is legitimate not because its citizens once agreed to it, but because it can continually demonstrate that its exercise of power serves their flourishing. This is a demanding standard. It requires transparency, accountability, and — as I explore in <a href="/the-obligation-to-dissent/" class="backlink">my essay on dissent</a> — a genuine tolerance for those who challenge the state's claims.</p>

        <p>The question of <a href="/on-moral-luck/" class="backlink">moral luck</a> haunts the social contract as well. Those born into well-functioning democracies did nothing to deserve their fortune, just as those born under tyranny did nothing to deserve their suffering. Any reimagined social contract must reckon with this brute arbitrariness — not as an afterthought, but as its starting point.</p>

        <p>We need a political philosophy that begins with honesty: none of us chose this. The question is not whether we consented, but whether what we have can be justified to those who bear its burdens most heavily.</p>
