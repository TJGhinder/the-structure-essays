        <p>Anything <em>could</em> be. Anything at all. Use your imagination and envision it; Time moving backwards and forwards at once. A universe where space doesn't exist, and distance has no meaning. A single atom larger than the entire cosmos.</p>

        <p>Mind can construct anything—but the real question is: can those constructions <em>cool down</em> into reality? Can they reach the level of sufficient, self-consistent sense, where you could build a universe from them?</p>

        <p>Mostly, no. Most possibilities collapse under their own contradictions.</p>
        <p>For example, imagine a Universe where causality doesn't exist: </p>
        <p>In a non-causal universe, nothing links to anything else; rules cannot form; evolution cannot unfold. We could not find ourselves there, because our very existence requires a chain of cause-and-effect, stretched across time.</p>
        <p>Non-causal universes may exist, but we'd never have any way of interacting with them. If they do have a way to remain stable, certainly, we wouldn't be able to interact with them, being time-based creatures ourselves. Without evolution, I struggle to see how a Universe could stumble into advanced life, or consciousness we would recognize.</p>
        
        <p>But now, take a Universe like ours; one where each moment is linked to the moment before it.</p>
        <p>This structure of links is someting tangible, on which other 'things' can be built.</p>
        
        <p>From raw, unbounded possibility of anything the Universe <em>could</em> be—causality emerges as a more stable configuration than non-causality.</p>
        <p>Looking at it this way: <em>Of course</em> we find ourselves in a causal Universe.</p>

        <p>But, if we are "made of something else" then, what is the Universe, really?</p>
        
        <h2>Possibility as the Fundamental Unit</h2>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_theory"><strong>Constructor Theory</strong></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_theory"><strong>Assembly Theory</strong></a>, and the <a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org/"><strong>Wolfram Physics Project</strong></a> are all beginning to converge on a shared philosophical truth:</p>

        <blockquote>Possibility is the fundamental unit of existence. What we consider "real" is simply the subset of possibilities that have stabilized enough for us to perceive them.</blockquote>

        <p>"Collapse" is the name of this process. Possibilia entangle with each other, until they cohere into something stable—something "real."</p>

        <p>Our universe still bubbles with possibility. Virtual particles pop in and out of existence. Quantum objects exist in multiple states simultaneously, until they collapse into entanglement with the rest of reality. Particles literally do not obtain definite properties until they are measured. In a way, "raw reality" lies outside of spacetime, until it condenses into existence.</p>

        <p>My hand, for example, is made of atoms that are mostly empty space. In principle, I could push my hand against a wall and have it slip right through, the gaps between my atoms aligning perfectly with the gaps in the wall. It's a possible arrangement.</p>

        <p>But in practice, it never happens. The probability is so infinitesimally small that it might as well be zero. Instead, the overwhelming likelihood is that atoms repel atoms, and solidity prevails.</p>

        <p>We see tiny exceptions at the quantum level—<strong>quantum tunneling</strong>, where particles "leak" through barriers that should contain them. But when trillions of atoms act together, the odds of tunneling are effectively erased, and <em>solidity as a concept emerges.</em></p>

        <h2>Morality as Emergent Reality</h2>

        <p>Atoms themselves are not "tangible" in the everyday sense. They are possibilities that have collapsed into agreement with each other.</p>

        <p>By that same logic, morality—though "subjective"—can also harden into reality. When moral systems are self-consistent enough, they stabilize, shaping societies just as atoms shape matter.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Truth-telling</strong> persists across cultures, because reliable communication stabilizes cooperation.</li>
          <li><strong>Reciprocity</strong> (help those who help you) is an emergent law, because it produces flourishing communities.</li>
          <li><strong>Prohibitions on murder</strong> arise everywhere, because stable societies cannot persist without them.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These moral truths are not carved into the universe like gravity—but neither are atoms, until the fabric of the universe demands that they are.</p>

        <h2>The Parallel</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Possibilities harden into <strong>atoms</strong>, which form molecules, stars, and life.</li>
          <li>Possibilities also harden into <strong>morals</strong>, which form trust, culture, and societies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In both cases, stability emerges from the storm of raw possibility.</p>

        <p>This is as close to "God" as we may ever get: the recognition that out of infinite potential, some configurations stabilize, and from those stable patterns, everything we know is born.</p>
