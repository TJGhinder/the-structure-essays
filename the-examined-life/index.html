        <p>Self-reflection is not a luxury of the leisured class. It is the minimum requirement for moral agency. Without it, we act on inherited impulse and call it conviction. Socrates understood this when he declared the unexamined life not worth living — a statement so frequently quoted it has lost the weight of its provocation. He was not offering a lifestyle tip. He was issuing a warning.</p>

        <p>The examined life demands that we hold our beliefs up to scrutiny, that we ask not just <em>what</em> we think but <em>why</em>. This is harder than it sounds. Our reasons are often post-hoc rationalizations, stories we tell ourselves after the verdict has already been reached by some deeper, less articulate part of the mind. The work of examination is the work of catching ourselves in the act.</p>

        <blockquote>The unexamined life is not merely unfortunate — it is, in a precise sense, unowned. We cannot take credit for values we have never chosen.</blockquote>

        <p>This is where Socrates intersects with the modern concern for <a href="/virtue-in-the-digital-age/" class="backlink">virtue in our digital landscape</a>. The algorithms that curate our information do not examine; they optimize. They give us more of what we already click on, reinforcing the unexamined self rather than challenging it. The Socratic method — that relentless, irritating, magnificent questioning — is the antithesis of algorithmic curation.</p>

        <p>But examination alone is not enough. As I argue in <a href="/on-moral-luck/" class="backlink">my essay on moral luck</a>, even the most rigorously examined life is subject to forces beyond our control. The Stoics knew this. Marcus Aurelius wrote his <em>Meditations</em> not from a position of serene detachment but from the chaos of military campaigns and political betrayal. His self-examination was not a retreat from the world but an engagement with its worst.</p>

        <p>What does it mean to examine a life in 2026? It means interrogating our complicity in systems we did not design but from which we benefit. It means asking, as <a href="/the-obligation-to-dissent/" class="backlink">the tradition of principled dissent</a> has always asked, whether our silence is a choice we have made or merely a habit we have inherited. It means sitting with discomfort long enough to learn what it has to teach us.</p>

        <p>The examined life is not the comfortable life. But it is the only life that belongs to us.</p>
