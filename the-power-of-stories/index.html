        <p>The mathematics of evolution reveal an uncomfortable truth: species survive not by perceiving reality as it is, but by perceiving it in whatever way maximizes their reproductive fitness. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYp5XuGYqqY" target="_blank">Donald Hoffman's work</a> demonstrates that natural selection actively selects against accurate perception when survival is at stake. We are not truth-seeking machines. We are survival machines that use whatever stories work.</p>

        <p>Consider a creature physiologically incapable of swimming. For such a being, evolutionary pressure would favor perceiving water not as the neutral substance it is, but as something actively threatening — perhaps as scalding, as poisonous, as fundamentally dangerous. The creature might experience water as white-hot to the touch. This perception is false, but it is useful. The story that water is dangerous promotes survival even though water is not inherently dangerous at all.</p>

        <p>Humanity inherited this mechanism. At some point in our deep past, we began telling ourselves useful stories, and groups with compelling narratives outcompeted groups with weak ones. The truth of these stories mattered far less than their power to coordinate action, inspire sacrifice, and bind communities together across generations.</p>

        <blockquote>By the laws of evolution, the oldest stories that remain with us endure not because they are true, but because they are useful.</blockquote>

        <p>And "useful" here does not mean objectively correct or morally superior. It means possessing features that lend themselves to replication — mechanisms of spread, hooks for the human psyche, frameworks that structure societies in ways that persist. Christianity's promise of eternal reward and threat of eternal punishment. Islam's daily rhythms of prayer and community. The caste system's cosmic justification for social order. These narratives spread not through logical argument but through psychological and social fitness.</p>

        <p>One set of ideas exceedingly well-adapted for replication is capitalism — the story that self-interest, properly channeled through markets, produces collective good. Yet paradoxically, the world's most enduring narratives are fundamentally anti-capitalist. Approximately 71% of humanity subscribes to one of the major religious traditions, all of which subordinate profit to higher values:</p>

        <p><strong>Christianity</strong> condemns greed and the worship of wealth — "the love of money is the root of all evil." Early Christian communities practiced communal sharing (Acts 2:44-45), and Jesus's teachings consistently critiqued exploitation and economic inequality. The Church Fathers saw unlimited accumulation as incompatible with Christian virtue.</p>

        <p><strong>Islam</strong> prohibits interest (<em>riba</em>), speculation, and exploitation — the very mechanisms of capitalist finance. It mandates <em>zakat</em>, redistributive almsgiving, and discourages hoarding. Wealth is understood as a moral trust from God, not absolute personal property to be maximized without constraint.</p>

        <p><strong>Judaism</strong> embeds economic redistribution into its legal structure. The Sabbatical year (<em>Shmita</em>) cancels debts and mandates land rest every seven years. The Jubilee (<em>Yovel</em>) every fifty years restores land to original owners — effectively resetting wealth inequality. <em>Tzedakah</em>, often translated as charity, literally means justice. Redistribution is obligation, not generosity. The Prophets condemned exploitation, merchants' dishonesty, and wealth hoarding with a fury that echoes through millennia.</p>

        <p><strong>Hinduism</strong> treats the pursuit of wealth (<em>artha</em>) as legitimate but subordinate to duty (<em>dharma</em>) and liberation (<em>moksha</em>). Economic activity must be guided by moral and social obligations, not profit maximization. Greed and attachment to material success are condemned as obstacles to spiritual development.</p>

        <p><strong>Buddhism</strong> rejects desire and craving — the psychological engines of consumer capitalism. <em>Right Livelihood</em> forbids work that harms others or feeds greed. The tradition advocates simplicity, interdependence, and non-attachment over accumulation. The entire edifice of Buddhist practice aims to dissolve precisely the self-centered striving that capitalism requires.</p>

        <p>The pattern is unmistakable: critique of greed and materialism, moral duty to share wealth, limits on accumulation and exploitation, communal or reciprocal economics, spiritual or ethical value above profit. These are not marginal features but <a href="/on-moral-frameworks/" class="backlink">foundational moral frameworks</a> that have structured human civilization for millennia.</p>

        <p>Of course, subscription to these beliefs does not guarantee adherence. Christian Nationalism in the United States demonstrates how religious language can be weaponized in service of precisely the accumulation and domination its source texts condemned. The gap between professed belief and lived practice is a permanent feature of human societies.</p>

        <p>But this gap itself reveals something important: there is no evolutionary pressure to abandon useful stories so long as their outcomes remain within the bounds that social fabric can safely carry. A religion requiring infant sacrifice from neighboring tribes would be eliminated through war or internal collapse. But a religion promoting charitable giving, mutual aid, and restraint on exploitation builds societies that endure. The stories persist not despite their anti-capitalist content but because of it.</p>

        <blockquote>The muscle of community building is beginning to atrophy in modern American culture. The nobility of giving has disintegrated.</blockquote>

        <p>What has changed is not the presence of selfish actors — these have always existed — but their elevation to cultural ideal. Being rich now equals being smart. Saying outrageous things on the internet can make you rich, and so outrageous becomes synonymous with intelligent. Contrarianism is held up as virtue regardless of whether the contrarian position has merit. The stories that "my unearned opinion is as good as your earned one" and "if you're rich, you've earned it and are the best among us" have corroded the foundations of shared reality.</p>

        <p>People who become wealthy through dishonesty or outrage are supercharged to stardom. Rage drives engagement, and profit-seeking entities capitalize on manufacturing bad stories for audiences to connect to. The algorithmic amplification of division is not accidental but structural. As I explore in <a href="/the-attention-economy/" class="backlink">my essay on the attention economy</a>, when profit depends on engagement and engagement flows from anger, the system inexorably produces content designed to enrage.</p>

        <p>The deeper problem is that people have stopped seeing traditional narratives of communal obligation as valid, or have granted themselves permission to bend them in service of individual gain. As they do so, they adopt what might be called selfish stories — narratives that place the self at the center and other people as means to personal ends. Hyperindividualism is not merely culturally corrosive but biologically cancerous.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XheAMrS2vcY" target="_blank">Michael Levin's work on bioelectricity</a> demonstrates that cancer is literally caused by cells forgetting they are part of a larger organism. The cancer cell pursues its own replication without constraint, destroying the system that gives it life. "What if that kid would've cured cancer?" is a common refrain in English, deployed to argue for the value of potential life. But hyperindividuality <em>is</em> social cancer — the breakdown of coordination between parts in service of selfish replication that destroys the whole.</p>

        <p>If this diagnosis is correct, then our path forward becomes clear, if not easy. We cannot return to the particular stories of the past — the specific religious and cultural narratives that bound previous generations are products of their time and place. But we can recognize the function those stories served and work to create new narratives that fulfill it.</p>

        <p>We need stories that bind us to each other and to future generations. Stories that make mutual care not a sacrifice but an expression of our deepest nature. Stories that recognize individual flourishing as inseparable from collective thriving. Stories that are psychologically compelling, socially functional, and — here is the difficult part — capable of spreading through a media environment optimized for their opposite.</p>

        <blockquote>Our only way out is good stories.</blockquote>

        <p>Not true stories, necessarily — evolution has already demonstrated that truth is not what drives narrative survival. But stories that are good in the sense that they produce outcomes we can live with, societies we want to inhabit, futures we can offer to those who come after us. Stories that remember, as <a href="/the-examined-life/" class="backlink">the examined life</a> requires, that we are not isolated atoms but fundamentally interconnected beings whose individual welfare is inextricable from the welfare of the whole.</p>

        <p>The question is not whether we will have stories — we are storytelling creatures, incapable of perceiving the world except through narrative. The question is what stories we will tell, and whether we can muster the collective will to elevate narratives of connection over narratives of division before the latter complete their work of dissolution.</p>
